# MUSA 650 Homework 3: Exploring Applications of Remote Sensing in Urban Planning

This assignment is designed to help you explore the diverse applications of remote sensing in urban planning by examining either a technical research paper or a real-world practical implementation. You will create a visual and engaging summary that can be shared with your classmates and potentially with a wider audience (e.g., LinkedIn or Medium).

We will make time in class to present the results with each other. Please submit your work as a document (e.g., PDF, .docx, etc.) uploaded to your GitHub repository, opening a pull request to the main repo as usual.

## Step 1: Choose Your Focus

Choose **one** of the following options to explore:

1. **Technical Research Paper**: Find an academic paper on Google Scholar that presents a technical or methods-focused application of remote sensing, such as a novel spectral analysis technique, a machine learning model, or another advanced remote sensing method. The paper must focus on a country outside of the United States.
2. **Real-World Use Case**: Identify a practical implementation of remote sensing within a business, nonprofit, or government context outside the United States. This could be an example of remote sensing applied in urban planning, environmental monitoring, disaster response, or another relevant area.

## Step 2: Create a Shareable Summary

Your task is to create a summary that is **visual, compelling, and easily shareable**. You can choose **one** of the following formats for your summary:

1. **Medium-Style Article**: Write a 300–500 word Medium-style article that introduces your chosen research or application to a broad audience. Include an engaging opening, a brief explanation of the application, key insights, and a question for further thought. Add at least one relevant visual (e.g., image, map, or chart) to enhance the article.
2. **Slide Deck (5-7 Slides)**: Design a short slide deck that presents your chosen research or application. Include a title slide, 1–2 slides for background, 2–3 slides for key takeaways and insights, and a final slide with an open-ended question. Use visuals such as screenshots, diagrams, or thematic icons.
3. **Infographic or One-Pager**: Create a visually engaging one-page document that summarizes the key points of your research or application. Break down the information into sections with headings, bullet points, and icons or visuals to make it easy to follow.

## Step 3: Include Key Elements

In your summary, be sure to include:

- **Purpose**: Describe the purpose of the research or practical application.
- **Impact**: Explain why this application is significant or how it contributes to urban planning.
- **Key Takeaways**: Highlight any surprising findings or key insights.
- **Question for Further Thought**: Pose an open-ended question inspired by your research or application.
- **Citation**: Include a citation for the academic paper or real-world application.
